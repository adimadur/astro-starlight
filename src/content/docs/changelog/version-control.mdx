# Version Control

Version Control in **CodePup AI** helps you stay safe while experimenting with AI-generated apps.  
Every time you generate, modify, or enhance your app — a new version is automatically created.

---

## How It Works

<Aside type="tip" title="Smart version history"/>
Each project maintains up to **20 latest versions**, ensuring your workspace stays lean yet recoverable.

---

### Automatic Saving

Whenever you:
- Regenerate sections of your app,
- Apply code edits through prompts,
- Attach new components, assets, or files,

CodePup automatically snapshots that state as a new version.

<Aside type="danger" title="Frontend-only support">
Version history is currently available only for frontend-based projects. Fullstack versions are not supported yet.
</Aside>


---

## Restoring Previous Versions

Click the **clock icon** 🕓 in the top bar to view your version history.

You'll see something like this:

![Version control panel](../assets/version.webp)

Select any previous version to restore it instantly.  
**CodePup** will automatically revert your project to that selected version.

---

## Version Limitations

- Only the **latest 20 versions** are stored.
- Older ones are automatically pruned to save space.
- File uploads and custom assets attached to older versions are **retained** safely.

## Best Practices

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Combine with Export" icon="information">
        Export your generated project to GitHub occasionally for offline backups or code reviews.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Roll forward, not backward" icon="star">
        When restoring a version, make your new edits on top — this keeps your context recent.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

> 🐾 With **CodePup AI**, version control isn't just about recovery — it's about **creative safety** while experimenting with AI-powered code generation.
