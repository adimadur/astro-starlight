# Publish Your Project

After generating or modifying your app, you can **publish** it directly from the CodePup interface.  
Publishing makes your project accessible via a unique live URL that you can share instantly.

---

## Deployment Overview

Publishing is available once your project build is successful and the **preview** is visible.

The generated link follows this format:

{/* https://<project-name>-<unique-id>.codepup.app */}


Each project has its own dedicated subdomain that always points to the **latest deployment**.

![Publish panel](../assets/release-log/publish.webp)
</div>

## Continuous Updates

Whenever you modify and re-deploy your app:

- The same project URL remains active.  
- The new deployment automatically replaces the previous one.  
- Visitors will always see your **latest published version**.

This ensures stable links without version conflicts or duplicate URLs.

<Aside type="note" title="Single deployment URL">
  Each project maintains a single deployment address. Older builds are not accessible once a new deployment is published.

## How to Publish

1. Open your project in CodePup.  
2. Ensure your app preview is available and error-free.  
3. Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner.  
4. Click on **Generate shareable URL**.  
5. Copy the link and share it with anyone.

That's it — your live site is now accessible publicly.
