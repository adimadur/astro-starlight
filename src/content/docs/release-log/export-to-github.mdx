# Export to GitHub

We are introducing **GitHub Export**, a new way to securely store, version, and manage your generated projects outside CodePup AI.  
This release makes it easy to connect your GitHub account and push your project directly into a repository you control.

## What’s New

With this feature, you can:
- Authenticate using GitHub OAuth  
- View your username and avatar after connection  
- Provide a repository name (defaulted to your project’s name)  
- Export your project for the first time, or  
- Update the same repository when the project is modified  

This ensures your work remains accessible, auditable, and versioned—right in your GitHub workflow.

## Requirements

<Aside type="danger" title="Plan Requirement">

## How It Works

### 1. Connect Your GitHub Account  
Click **Connect with GitHub** to authenticate your GitHub account.  
Once connected, your profile name and avatar will appear in the UI.

### 2. Choose Your Repository  
Set a repository name for your export.  
By default, we prefill this field with your current project name, but you may customize it.

### 3. Export or Update  
- **Initial Export:** Creates a new GitHub repository with your generated project.  
- **Subsequent Updates:** After modifying your project in CodePup AI, export again to update the **same repository**, ensuring continuity and version clarity.
