# Supabase Integration

We are introducing **native Supabase integration** for fullstack projects generated through CodePup AI.  
This release removes the need for manual setup—CodePup now provisions, manages, and links Supabase resources automatically using a single access token.

---

## What’s New

<Aside type="tip" title="One-step Supabase Setup">
    Provide your Supabase access token and CodePup handles the entire
    provisioning process for you.
</Aside>

Once an access token is entered, CodePup automatically:

-   Creates a Supabase **organization** (if you don't already have one)
-   Creates a new **Supabase project** inside that organization
-   Links the Supabase project to your CodePup project
-   Configures database URLs, API keys, and environment variables internally

There is **no manual dashboard work** required — everything is provisioned instantly.

---

## Seamless Database & Storage Support

### Intelligent Schema Generation

CodePup analyzes your project type and generates appropriate Supabase schemas, relationships, and seed entries automatically.  
This allows dashboards, admin panels, and complex fullstack applications to work out-of-the-box.

### CSV / Excel Dashboard Creation

When building dashboards from spreadsheets, CodePup automatically:

-   Cleans the dataset
-   Validates and filters up to **1,000 records**
-   Inserts the processed records directly into your Supabase database
-   Configures relevant tables and relationships

This eliminates the need for manual imports or schema setup.

### Automatic Storage Buckets

Depending on your application type, CodePup provisions Supabase storage buckets automatically:

-   User avatars
-   Product images
-   File uploads
-   Media-heavy projects like Pinterest-style apps, drive clones, or multi-asset platforms

Every bucket is created and wired into the generated codebase seamlessly.

## Why This Matters

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Zero Setup Required" icon="star">
        Projects now become fully functional fullstack apps after entering only
        one token.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Production-Ready Architecture" icon="approve-check-circle">
        Databases, schemas, storage, and environment variables are configured
        with no manual input.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Accelerated Development" icon="rocket">
        Skip hours of setup and start iterating or modifying your fullstack app
        instantly.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

1. Generate a new **Fullstack** project in CodePup.
2. When prompted, paste your **Supabase Access Token**.
3. CodePup provisions and links all required resources automatically.
4. Start working with your connected database and storage immediately.

<Aside type="danger" title="Token Requirement">
    A valid Supabase access token is required. Without it, fullstack generation
    will not proceed.
</Aside>

## Looking Ahead

This is the first step toward deeper Supabase automation.

Upcoming releases will focus on performance optimizations, safer schema evolution, deeper API insights, and more intelligent models that understand your project context even better.

CodePup is committed to making fullstack generation truly **end-to-end**, and this integration is a major milestone toward that goal.
