<h1 className='hidden' >UI Component Integration</h1>

We’re introducing a new way to bring world-class UI into your generated projects: **copy-prompt component integration**.

This release allows developers to take component prompts from libraries such as **21st.dev** and insert them directly into any CodePup project — with full dependency handling, file creation, and placement automation.

---

## How It Works

When you copy a component prompt from external libraries  
(for example: <a href="https://21st.dev/community/components">https://21st.dev/community/components</a>)  
and paste it into CodePup, the system now understands:

- the component’s structure  
- its required dependencies  
- its related files (assets, helper files, styles)  
- where it should live inside your project

After analyzing the prompt, CodePup automatically installs dependencies, generates files, and integrates the component into your existing codebase.

<Aside type="tip" title="Flexible placement">
Tell CodePup where the component should appear — such as a specific page, section, or layout — and it will position it there automatically.

## Example Workflow

<Steps>

  1. Browse Components
    Choose a component from libraries like 21st.dev or any other prompt-ready UI source.

  2. Copy the Prompt
    Copy the component’s provided prompt directly from the UI library.

  3. Paste Into CodePup
    Use the “Modify project” flow and paste the prompt.  
    CodePup interprets the component and prepares the integration.

  4. Choose Placement
    Tell CodePup where the new component belongs — a page, section, route, or layout block.

  5. Automatic Integration
    Dependencies are installed, files are created, and the component becomes part of your app.

</Steps>

## Why This Matters

This release bridges the gap between AI-generated apps and modern component ecosystems.  
Users can now enrich their projects with high-quality, production-ready components — without manually wiring dependencies, navigating file structures, or troubleshooting broken imports.

## Supported Use Cases

- Importing complex UI from 21st.dev  
- Adding dashboards, forms, tables, charts, navigation components, and full sections  
- Dropping in hero sections, landing pages, pricing layouts, and complete templates  
- Installing Tailwind, Radix, ShadCN-style components, or design-system-ready elements  
- Combining CodePup-generated pages with premium community UI components

<Aside type="caution" title="Component limitations">
Some component libraries may require framework-specific constraints.  
CodePup will inform you if additional configuration is needed.
</Aside>

## Looking Ahead

Future releases will expand this integration with:

- smarter component positioning  
- automatic routing awareness  
- deeper support for multi-file component packs  
- improved compatibility with emerging UI ecosystems

This is a significant step toward a world where your CodePup projects can grow with any design system, any component library, and any UI style — simply by pasting a prompt.
