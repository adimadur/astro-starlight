## Building with CodePup AI

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">How do I build efficiently with CodePup AI?</span></summary>

To get the best results, start small and build step by step.  
Begin with your website structure (like “Create a landing page for my product”) and then refine each section — such as “Add testimonials below the hero” or “Change the button color to blue.”  
This ensures accurate generation, smooth iterations, and minimal credit usage.

</details>

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">What should I do if I hit an error?</span></summary>

If you encounter an error, try breaking your instruction into smaller steps, rephrasing it, or asking CodePup:  
“Why is this error happening?” or “Fix this error.”

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">Can I connect my project to a backend to store data?</span></summary>

Yes! If you’re building a dynamic or interactive website, you can easily connect it to a backend.  
CodePup supports Supabase for full-stack features like authentication, database, and APIs.  
When creating a full-stack website, just connect Supabase — CodePup will handle database setup, API management, and integration automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">Can I add login or authentication to my website?</span></summary>

Yes! CodePup can automatically integrate Supabase Auth.  
Just mention in your prompt that you want login or signup functionality, and CodePup will set it up seamlessly.

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">Can I add an admin dashboard to my website?</span></summary>

Yes! For interactive full-stack websites, CodePup can generate a complete admin dashboard, allowing you to manage data, track users, and monitor activity — all connected to your backend.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">Can I store sensitive API keys in CodePup AI?</span></summary>

No — you should never paste your API keys directly into CodePup chat.  
You must store them securely inside **Supabase Edge Function secrets**.  
CodePup will use these secrets automatically without exposing them.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">How long does it take to complete a project?</span></summary>

Project time depends on complexity.  
Small static sites can be generated in minutes, while full-stack apps may take longer as you refine features.  
To build faster, break requests into smaller, focused tasks and iterate.

</details>

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: 600;">Does CodePup host my websites?</span></summary>

Yes — instant hosting is included for generated projects.  
You can also export your project and host it elsewhere if preferred.
