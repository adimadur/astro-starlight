## Credit Display

You can easily track your **credit balance and usage** right inside the CodePup AI interface — no need to dig through settings.
- On the **dashboard (index page)**, your **total available credits** are shown at the **top-right corner** of the screen.
<div class="rounded-lg shadow-lg overflow-hidden border border-gray-200">
![Publish panel](../assets/introduction/credit_display_indexpage.webp)
</div>

<br/>

- When **building a project**, your **current credits** are also visible at the **top-right corner** of the editor — so you always know how many credits you have before generating or modifying anything.
<div class="rounded-lg shadow-lg overflow-hidden border border-gray-200">
![Publish panel](../assets/introduction/credit_display_chatpage.webp)
</div>

Each time you perform an action (like **Generate** or **Modify**), your remaining credits update instantly.

## Credit Rollovers

Unused monthly credits **automatically roll over** at the end of your billing cycle, as long as your subscription remains active.
- **Monthly plans:** Rolled-over credits remain valid for **1 additional month**
- **Annual plans:** Rolled-over credits remain valid for the **entire duration** of your annual plan
Each time you perform an action (like **Generate** or **Modify**), your remaining credits update instantly.

## Upgrading or Downgrading

- You can upgrade instantly from your dashboard.  
- Downgrades take effect in the **next billing cycle**.  
- Your projects remain safe and accessible even if your subscription ends.

## Refund Policy

All payments are processed through third-party providers such as Stripe or Razorpay. Fees are non-refundable unless required by law. Paid Credits expire 2 months after purchase; free Credits expire at the end of their allocation.
